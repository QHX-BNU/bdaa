| SubjectId        | Each subject covers an area of mathematics, at varying degrees of gran ularity. We provide IDs for each topic associated with a question in a list. Example topics could include Algebra , Data and Statistics , and Geometry and Measure . These subjects are arranged in a tree structure, so that for instance Factorising is the parent subject of Factorising into a Single Bracket . We provide details of this tree in an additional le subject metadata.csv which contains the subject name and tree level associated with each SubjectId, in addition to the SubjectId of its parent subject. | [3, 71, 98, 209]<br> |
| Question content | In Tasks 3 and 4, in addition to the topics, we will also provide the image presented to the student for each question, as shown in Figure 1, for each of the questions. The question images have been shared solely for the purpose of this competition and must not be used for any other purpose. The question images must not be printed or shared with anyone outside of the competition. The question wording is contained in the images but will not be made available as text. ***id of the image***                                                                                           | 684<br>              |
