| chapter_text | the text of the chapter         | 1.1 Explain the Importance of Accounting and Distinguish between Financial and Managerial Accounting Accounting is the process of organizing, analyzing, and communicating financial information that is used for decision-making. Financial information is typically prepared by accountants —those trained in the specific techniques and practices of the profession. This course explores many of the topics and techniques related to the accounting profession. While many students will directly apply the knowledge gained in this course to continue their education and become accountants and business professionals, others might pursue different career paths. However, a solid understanding of accounting can for many still serve as a useful resource. In fact, it is hard to think of a profession where a foundation in the principles of accounting would not be beneficial. Therefore, one of the goals of this course is to provide a solid understanding of how financial information is prepared and used in the workplace, regardless of your particular career path. Think It Through Expertise Every job or career requires a certain level of technical expertise and an understanding of the key aspects necessary to be successful. The time required to develop the expertise for a particular job or career varies from several months to much longer. For instance, doctors, in addition to the many years invested in the classroom, invest a significant amount of time providing care to patients under the supervision of more experienced doctors. This helps medical professionals develop the necessary skills to quickly and effectively diagnose and treat the various medical conditions they spent so many years learning about. Accounting also typically takes specialized training. Top accounting managers often invest many years and have a significant amount of experience mastering complex financial transactions. Also, in addition to attending college, earning professional certifications and investing in continuing education are necessary to develop a skill set sufficient to becoming experts in an accounting professional field. The level and type of training in accounting are often dependent on which of the myriad options of accounting fields the potential accountant chooses to enter. To familiarize you with some potential opportunities, Describe the Varied Career Paths Open to Individuals with an Accounting Education examines many of these career options. In addition to covering an assortment of possible career opportunities, we address some of the educational and experiential certifications that are available. Why do you think accountants (and doctors) need to be certified and secure continuing education? In your response, defend your position with examples.
