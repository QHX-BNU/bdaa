For multiple-step MWPs, the formula can be represented as an expression tree. The non-leaf nodes are operations and the leaf-nodes are operands. We denote the operation in the **root node** to be the **Solution-type** of this MWP, and the other operations on the non-leaf nodes are sub-types (in a depth-first travel manner) of the MWP and are denoted in the **Subtype** attribute of the **Solution-type**.
