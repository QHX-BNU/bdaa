| Duration (sec)                         | Duration of the transaction in seconds. This is the time of the current transaction minus that of the preceding transaction or problem start event—whichever is closer in time to the current transaction. If this difference is greater than 10 minutes, or if the prior transaction occurred during a different user session, DataShop reports the duration as null (a dot). If the current transaction is preceded by neither another transaction or a problem start event, duration is shown as null. The duration is formatted without decimal places if the two times used in the calculation were without millisecond precision. | 1                                                                                                                                                       |
| Student Response Type                  | The type of attempt made by the student (e.g., "ATTEMPT" or "HINT_REQUEST").

| Problem Start Time                     | If the problem start time is not given in the original log data, then it is set to the time of the last transaction of the prior problem. If there is no prior problem for the session, the time of the earliest transaction is used. Earliest transaction time is equivalent to the minimum transaction time for the earliest step of the problem.
