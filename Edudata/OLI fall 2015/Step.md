| Step Start Time                    | The step start time is determined one of three ways: If it's the first step of the problem, the step start time is the same as the problem start time If it's a subsequent step, then the step start time is the time of the preceding transaction, if that transaction is within 10 minutes. If it's a subsequent step and the elapsed time between the previous transaction and the first transaction of this step is more than 10 minutes, then the step start time is set to null as it's considered an unreliable value.

| Step Duration (sec)                | The elapsed time of the step in seconds, calculated by adding all of the durations for transactions that were attributed to the step. See the glossary entry for more detail. This column was previously labeled "Assistance Time". It differs from "Assistance Time" in that its values are derived by summing transaction durations, not finding the difference between only two points in time (step start time and the last correct attempt).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 23.13                                                                                                   |
| Correct Step Duration (sec)        | The step duration if the first attempt for the step was correct. This might also be described as "reaction time" since it's the duration of time from the previous transaction or problem start event to the correct attempt. See the glossary entry for more detail.

This differs from the transaction format, which optionally has "Condition Name" and "Condition Type" columns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | .                                                                                                       |
| KC (model_name)                    | (Only shown when the "Knowledge Components" option is selected.) Knowledge component(s) associated with the correct performance of this step. In the case of multiple KCs assigned to a single step, KC names are separated by two tildes ("~~").                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | identify_interaction                                                                                    |
| Opportunity (model_name)           | Only shown when the "Knowledge Components" option is selected.) An opportunity is the first chance on a step for a student to demonstrate whether he or she has learned the associated knowledge component. Opportunity number is therefore a count that increases by one each time the student encounters a step with the listed knowledge component. In the case of multiple KCs assigned to a single step, opportunity number values are separated by two tildes ("~~") and are given in the same order as the KC names. Check here to see how opportunity count is computed when Event Type column is present in transaction data.                                                                     | 1                                                                                                       |
| Predicted Error Rate (model_name)  | A hypothetical error rate based on the Additive Factor Model (AFM) algorithm. A value of "1" is a prediction that a student's first attempt will be an error (incorrect attempt or hint request); a value of "0" is a prediction that the student's first attempt will be correct. For specifics, see below "Predicted Error Rate" and how it's calculated. In the case of multiple KCs assigned to a single step, Datashop implements a compensatory sum across all of the KCs, thus a single value of predicted error rate is provided (i.e., the same predicted error rate for each KC assigned to a step). For more detail on Datashop's implementation for multi-skilled step, see Model Values page. | 0.4373                                                                                                  |

什么是指向这一步骤的操作？？

## tip2
不应该是0吗？
