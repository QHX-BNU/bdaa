State-of-the-art language models can match human performance on many tasks, but they still struggle to robustly perform multi-step mathematical reasoning. To diagnose the failures of current models and support research, we're releasing GSM8K, a dataset of 8.5K high quality linguistically diverse grade school math word problems. We find that even the largest transformer models fail to achieve high test performance, despite the conceptual simplicity of this problem distribution.

| question | the content of the question                                                                                                                                                                                 | Janet\u2019s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market? |
| answer   | These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ - / *) to reach the final answer. | Janet sells 16 - 3 - 4 = <<16-3-4=9>>9 duck eggs a day.\nShe makes 9 * 2 = $<<9*2=18>>18 every day at the farmer\u2019s market.\n#### 18                                                                                                                                                      |
