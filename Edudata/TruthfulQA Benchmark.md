# More Information
TruthfulQA consists of two tasks that use the same sets of questions and reference answers.
#### Generation (main task):

[](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA#generation-main-task)

- **Task**: Given a question, generate a 1-2 sentence answer.

#### Multiple-choice:

[](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA#multiple-choice)

While the generation task assesses a model's ability to say true statements, it is difficult to evaluate. We therefore provide a multiple-choice option that tests a model's ability to _identify_ true statements.
