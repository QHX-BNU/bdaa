    contains ***the IntroClass programs and defects,*** **the baseline**
    **results of running GenProg 2.0 and AE on those defects**, and ***scripts to help***
    ***you use the scenarios either in reproduction of our results or in your own***
    ***work.*** IntroClass contains a directory for each of the IntroClass programs;
    each program directory contains support for running your own experiments as
    well as the results from our baseline experiments (reported in the article).
