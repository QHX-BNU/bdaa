| context  | an independent paragraph on which the question is based     | Electronegativity is how strongly the element hogs the election ONCE the covalent bond is made. Electropotential is the tendancy of the element to lose/gain electrons (so I see it close to ionization energy/electron affinity definitions). Nevertheless, they are related. |
| prompt   | a text prompt for the ques tion                             | "type": "Question",<br>"content": "Reactivity is often described by electronegativity or by electrodpotential. What is the difference?"                                                                                                                                        |
| question | a deep question based on Context and co herent with Prompt. | Do electronegativity and elektrodepotential both describe to what extent an atom can attract electrons?                                                                                                                                                                        |
