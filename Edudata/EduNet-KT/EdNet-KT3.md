In _Santa_, a student may participate in various learning activities aside from solving questions, such as reading through experts' commentary on a question or watching lectures provided by the system. EdNet-KT3 incorporates such learning activities by adding the following actions to the EdNet-KT2 dataset. Such actions can be utilized by to infer the impact of learning activities to each student's knowledge state. For example, one may analyze the time each student have spent studying a given material by subtracting the `timestamp`s of `enter` and `quit` actions and use this to study the effect of students' different learning behaviors.
