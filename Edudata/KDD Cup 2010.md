# Tip1
 Four key terms form the building blocks of our data. These are **problem**, **step**, **knowledge component**, and **opportunity**. To more concretely define these terms, we’ll use the following scenario:
 Using a computer tutor for geometry, a student completes a problem where she is asked to find the area of a piece of scrap metal left over after removing a circular area (the end of a can) from a metal square (Figure 1). The student enters everything in the worksheet except for the row labels and the column and ‘Unit’ labels for the first three columns.

# Tip2
## **Problem**
A problem is a task for a student to perform that typically **involves multiple steps**. In the example above, the problem asks the student to find the area of a piece of scrap metal left over after removing a circular area (the end of a can) from a metal square (Figure 1). The row labeled ‘Question 1’ in the worksheet corresponds to a single problem. **In language domains, such tasks are more often called activities or exercises rather than problems.** A language activity, for example, could involve finding and correcting all of the grammatical errors in a paragraph.
## **Step**
**A step is an observable part of the solution to a problem**. Because steps are observable, they are partly determined by the user interface available to the student for solving the problem. (It is not necessarily the case that the interface completely determines the steps: for example, the student might be expected to create new rows or columns of a table before filling in their entries.) In the example problem above, the steps for the first question are: This whole collection of steps comprises the solution. The last step can be considered the “answer”, and the others are “intermediate” steps.
- find the radius of the end of the can (a circle)
- find the length of the square ABCD
- find the area of the end of the can
- find the area of the square ABCD
- find the area of the left-over scrap
## **Transaction**
Students might not (and often do not) complete a problem by performing only the correct steps - the student might request a hint from the tutor, or enter an incorrect value. We refer to the actions of a student that is working towards performing a step correctly as transactions. A transaction is an interaction between the student and the tutoring system. Each hint request, incorrect attempt, or correct attempt is a transaction, and each recorded transaction is referred to as an attempt for a step. In Table 1, transactions have been consolidated and displayed by student and step, producing a step record table. This is the format of the data provided to you in this competition. A step record is a summary of all of a given student’s attempts for a given step.

##  **Opportunity**
An opportunity is a chance for a student to demonstrate whether he or she has learned a given knowledge component. A student’s opportunity count for a given knowledge component increases by 1 each time the student encounters a step that requires this knowledge component. See the Opportunity Count column of Table 1 for examples. An opportunity is both a test of whether a student knows a knowledge component and a chance for the student to learn it. While students may make multiple attempts at a step or request hints from a tutor (these are transactions), the whole set of attempts are considered a single opportunity. As a student works through steps in problems, he/she will have multiple opportunities to apply or learn a knowledge component. For all competition data sets, each record will be a step that contains the following attributes: For the test portion of the challenge data sets, values will not be provided for the following columns:
## KC
A knowledge component is a piece of information that can be used to accomplish tasks, perhaps along with other knowledge components. Knowledge component is a generalization of everyday terms like concept, principle, fact, or skill, and cognitive science terms like schema, production rule, misconception, or facet.

Each step in a problem requires the student to know something, a relevant concept or skill, to perform that step correctly. In given data sets, each step can be labeled with one or more hypothesized knowledge components needed—see the last column of . for example KC labels. In line 5 of Table 1, the researcher has hypothesized that the student needs to know CIRCLE-AREA to answer (POGAREA Q1). In line 6, the COMPOSE-AREAS knowledge component is hypothesized to be needed to answer (SCRAP-METAL-AREA Q1).

Every knowledge component is associated with one or more steps. One or more knowledge components can be associated with a step. This association is typically originally defined by the problem author, but researchers can provide alternative knowledge components and associations with steps; together these are known as a Knowledge Component Model.

## Opportunity
An opportunity is a chance for a student to demonstrate whether he or she has learned a given knowledge component. A student's opportunity count for a given knowledge component increases by 1 each time the student encounters a step that requires this knowledge component. See the Opportunity Count column of [Table 1](https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/KDDCup/rules_data_format.jsp#table-1) for examples.

An opportunity is both a test of whether a student knows a knowledge component and a chance for the student to learn it. While students may make multiple attempts at a step or request hints from a tutor (these are transactions), the whole set of attempts are considered a single opportunity. As a student works through steps in problems, he/she will have multiple opportunities to apply or learn a knowledge component.
