- Quality Estimation: input with "old_file" and "diff_hunk", we need to predict that whether the code change is not good and needs a comment.
    
- Comment Generation: input with "old_file" and "diff_hunk", we need to generate a comment for the change. An expected comment is as the "comment" above.
    
- Code Refinement: input with "old_file", "diff_hunk", and "comment", we need to change the code again according to the review comment. For the above example, as the comment indicated we don't needÂ _import torch.nn_, we just delete this line of code here
