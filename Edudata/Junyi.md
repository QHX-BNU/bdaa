The dataset contains the problem log and exercise-related information on the Junyi Academy ( [http://www.junyiacademy.org/](http://www.junyiacademy.org/) ), an E-learning platform established in 2012 on the basis of the open-source code released by Khan Academy. In addition, the annotations of exercise relationship we collected for building models are also available.
