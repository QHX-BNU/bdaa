Tom placed a ping pong ball in a catapult, pulled the catapult's arm back to a 45° angle, and launched the ball. Then, Tom launched another ping pong ball, this time pulling the catapult's arm back to a 30° angle. With each launch, his friend Justin measured the distance between the catapult and the place where the ball hit the ground. Tom and Justin repeated the launches with ping pong balls in four more identical catapults. They compared the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 45° angle to the distances the balls traveled when launched from a 30° angle. Figure: a catapult for launching ping pong balls. |

| lecture  | the lecture of the question          | Maps have four cardinal directions, or main directions. Those directions are north, south, east, and west. A compass rose is a set of arrows that point to the cardinal directions. A compass rose usually shows only the first letter of each cardinal direction. The north arrow points to the North Pole. On most maps, north is at the top of the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
